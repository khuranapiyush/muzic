# Facebook SDK iOS Integration - Summary

We've prepared the Facebook SDK integration for your React Native app. This document summarizes the changes made and recommends next steps.

## Current Status

The necessary configuration files have been updated for Facebook SDK integration:

1. **AppDelegate.swift**
   - Added Facebook SDK import: `import FBSDKCoreKit`
   - Added Facebook SDK initialization code 
   - Updated URL handling to support Facebook SDK

2. **Info.plist Configuration**
   - Confirmed existing Facebook SDK entries:
     - `FacebookAppID`: "2359835304391514"
     - `FacebookDisplayName`: "MakeMySong"
     - `LSApplicationQueriesSchemes` with required Facebook URL schemes
   - Added Facebook URL scheme to `CFBundleURLTypes`:
     ```xml
     <dict>
       <key>CFBundleTypeRole</key>
       <string>Editor</string>
       <key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>
       <array>
         <string>fb2359835304391514</string>
       </array>
     </dict>
     ```

## Integration Options

Due to compatibility issues between the current version of CocoaPods and your Xcode version, we recommend using Swift Package Manager to add the Facebook SDK to your iOS project:

### Recommended Approach: Swift Package Manager (SPM)

1. Open your Xcode project:
   ```bash
   open ios/muzic.xcworkspace
   ```

2. In Xcode, select File > Add Packages...

3. In the search field, enter: `https://github.com/facebook/facebook-ios-sdk`

4. Choose the latest stable version and select the required packages:
   - FacebookCore (required)
   - FacebookLogin (if needed)
   - FacebookShare (if needed)

5. Click "Add Package" to complete the integration

Detailed instructions are available in the `FACEBOOK_SDK_SPM_SETUP.md` file.

## Alternatives

If you prefer CocoaPods, you may need to:
1. Update CocoaPods to the latest version: `sudo gem install cocoapods`
2. Clean the CocoaPods cache: `pod cache clean --all`
3. Try pod installation again

## Verification

Once the SDK is installed via SPM, you can verify the integration by:

1. Building and running the iOS app
2. Checking the logs for any Facebook SDK initialization messages
3. Testing Facebook SDK functionality (login, sharing, events)

## Next Steps

1. Follow the Swift Package Manager instructions in `FACEBOOK_SDK_SPM_SETUP.md`
2. Build and run your app to verify the integration
3. Test your Facebook SDK features

The JavaScript integration with `react-native-fbsdk-next` is already configured and will work once the native SDK is properly installed.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:
- Make sure all required Facebook modules are added to your target
- Check that the dependency is correctly configured
- Verify your Info.plist has all the required Facebook SDK entries
- Consult the Facebook Developer documentation for more information
