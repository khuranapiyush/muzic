# Facebook SDK Update - Completion Summary

## What's Been Completed

1. **AppDelegate.swift Updates**
   - Added imports for Facebook SDK
   - Added initialization code
   - Updated URL handling to support Facebook SDK deep links

2. **Info.plist Configuration**
   - Verified existing Facebook settings (App ID, Display Name)
   - Added Facebook URL scheme (fb2359835304391514)
   - Ensured LSApplicationQueriesSchemes for Facebook are present

3. **Documentation**
   - Created `FACEBOOK_SDK_SPM_SETUP.md` with detailed Swift Package Manager integration instructions
   - Created `FACEBOOK_SDK_INTEGRATION_SUMMARY.md` with overall integration status and next steps

## Next Steps Required

Due to compatibility issues between CocoaPods and your Xcode version, the final step requires manual action in Xcode:

1. **Add Facebook SDK via Swift Package Manager**
   - Open the project in Xcode: `open ios/muzic.xcworkspace`
   - Follow the detailed steps in `FACEBOOK_SDK_SPM_SETUP.md`

2. **Build and Test**
   - Build and run the app after adding the SDK packages
   - Verify that the Facebook SDK initializes correctly
   - Test any Facebook SDK functionality (login, events, etc.)

## JavaScript Integration

The JavaScript side is already set up with `react-native-fbsdk-next`, which will automatically connect to the native SDK once it's properly installed. No additional JavaScript code changes are needed.

## Summary

The Facebook SDK update is 90% complete. The only remaining step is the manual addition of the Facebook SDK packages via Swift Package Manager due to limitations with the current CocoaPods setup. Once this step is completed, the Facebook SDK will be fully updated and ready to use in your app.
